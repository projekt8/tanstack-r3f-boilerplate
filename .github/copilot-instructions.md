# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You **MUST** read and follow the project context and rules defined in `AGENTS.md`.

This file (`AGENTS.md`) in the root of the repository is the single source of truth for:

- Tech Stack Versions (React 19, Tailwind v4)
- Coding Standards
- Architecture Patterns

Always refer to `AGENTS.md` before generating code.
